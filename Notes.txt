Implement "dead nodes". Marker for broken user code so that interpreter doesn't go down that branch and crash.

Should the parser be more relaxed about assigning subnodes? A broken tree is better than none at all. Error handling could be done in interpreter.

Implement either soft failure or soft interpreter for mouse hover and shiii.
I thinkg soft interpreter called only on mouse hover.
